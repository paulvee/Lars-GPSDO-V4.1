# Lars-GPSDO-V4.1
This is a significant improvement to the first version that can be found in a different repository

The BOM's are of limited value because I do not specify the actual mfg partnumbers that can be ordered. I merely specify the value and the footprint.

The Arduino Nano sketch has a number of improvements, most notably the support for obtaining the Qerr value from the NEO, the automatic TC functionality and support for a DS18B20 temperature sensor.
The sensor may change to an LM35 type to reduce the code size should that be needed.

A lot of detail cn be found on my Blog here: https://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2023/06/gpsdo-version-4.html
Be sure to visit that regularly because I'm not done with the project yet.
